# Code Refractor- Challenge
This project was based on improvng the accesibility of a website to improve the experince for end users. Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google.


The code was refactored and a number of improveemnts were made some of which were:
* Adding alt text to images
* Ensuring semantic elements where used when possible
* Ensuring all links were working 
* Adding a concise title element

From this project I have learned the considerations a developer must undertake to ensure his code is accesible to all users and I've also developed code refractoring skills that I can utlise in the future to help improve both my own code and others.
